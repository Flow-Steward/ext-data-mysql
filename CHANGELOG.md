# Changelog

## 1.3.9

- Rebuild Linux AMD64 and ARM64 native payloads with google.golang.org/api v0.315.0 on the pinned Toolbox v1.17.0 and verified Go 1.27.4 baseline.
- Preserve the other selected dependency versions, connector controls and approved profiles; reject the superseded Google API module during package verification.


## 1.3.8

- Rebuild native Linux payloads from official Toolbox v1.17.0 with the reviewed dependency security updates and Go 1.27.4.
- Build native artifacts in CI and generate checksums and provenance from the resulting binaries.

## 1.3.7

- Clarify workflow action names, descriptions and field help; add setup and input examples. Existing action IDs, input schemas and runtime behavior are preserved. Move the unchanged test launcher under tests/ so installer runtime checks accept the package.
